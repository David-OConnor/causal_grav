# Causual gravity

An n-body simulation where information is transmitted locally.
Experiments with a causal (Non-instantaneous) gravity simulation.

Continuous space? A discrete graph/grid?

I believe 2D will be sufficient for this.


## Notes
Look into, and add to your source: Alexandre Deur's theory that gravitons interact with each other. https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.05905(Likely other papers as well)

Note: Two factors to consider for what causes galaxy curves to differ from solar: 
 - Speed of light relative to distance
 - and mass distribution.

Deur thinks disc thickness is important. This is rel to your model ICs.

Grav field self interactions maybe important.

Lensing affecting force of gravity: Likely. Disc thickness may be important; you can start with a flat disc, but this
may have to change. What is the affect of disc thickness on roation curves?
