# Causual gravity

An n-body simulation where information is transmitted locally.
Experiments with a causal (Non-instantaneous) gravity simulation.

Continuous space? A discrete graph/grid?

I believe 2D will be sufficient for this.


## Notes
Look into, and add to your source: Alexandre Deur's theory that gravitons interact with each other. https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.05905(Likely other papers as well)

Note: Two factors to consider for what causes galaxy curves to differ from solar: 
 - Speed of light relative to distance
 - and mass distribution.

Deur thinks disc thickness is important. This is rel to your model ICs.

Grav field self interactions maybe important.

Lensing affecting force of gravity: Likely. Disc thickness may be important; you can start with a flat disc, but this
may have to change. What is the affect of disc thickness on roation curves?


Thought, re inst acc vs causal:
 - Gravity from central masses in the system will have a similar effect between the two; they are the same for stationary masses.
 - Gravity from edge masses will be different, as they move more; it takes a longer time for grav to propograte from these after they move.
 - For rotating masses like galaxies, perhaps the causal setup would cause no notable affects to the distribution
vice the naive n-body simulation, as each angular area is interchangeable. Would masses migrating radially change this?


GR effect to look into:
 - Lense-Thirring precession
 - Gravitomagnetism
 - Gerson Otto Ludwig's 2021 paper on this https://inspirehep.net/files/8d6f28c11efc8a0bb57121ab804da1a1
 - Frame-dragging
 - Cooperstock, Tieu: GR Resolves Galactic Rotation Without...: https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0507619
 - Another paper, from an amateur(?): https://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.07440
 - Perhaps: "weak field GR"
 - Look into the Bullet Cluster, in addition to rotation curves.
 - Mass currents
 - Another paper from 2021 on Gravitoelectromagnetism: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.00357


Another possibility: Self-interactions of the gravity field, and similar


Short summary of Ludwig's paper: https://scottlocklin.wordpress.com/2021/03/12/humble-tokamak-physicist-owns-generations-of-cosmological-wankers/

Note: It's not clear why galaxies have this central bubble, then flat spiral structure; vague points to angular momentum aren't sufficient. 

note: We likely will use the weak field approximation of GR?
