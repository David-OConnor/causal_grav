# Causual gravity

An n-body simulation where information is transmitted locally.
Experiments with a causal (Non-instantaneous) gravity simulation.

Continuous space? A discrete graph/grid?

I believe 2D will be sufficient for this.


## Notes
Look into, and add to your source: Alexandre Deur's theory that gravitons interact with each other. https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.05905(Likely other papers as well)

Note: Two factors to consider for what causes galaxy curves to differ from solar: 
 - Speed of light relative to distance
 - and mass distribution.

Deur thinks disc thickness is important. This is rel to your model ICs.

Grav field self interactions maybe important.

Lensing affecting force of gravity: Likely. Disc thickness may be important; you can start with a flat disc, but this
may have to change. What is the affect of disc thickness on roation curves?


Thought, re inst acc vs causal:
 - Gravity from central masses in the system will have a similar effect between the two; they are the same for stationary masses.
 - Gravity from edge masses will be different, as they move more; it takes a longer time for grav to propograte from these after they move.
 - For rotating masses like galaxies, perhaps the causal setup would cause no notable affects to the distribution
vice the naive n-body simulation, as each angular area is interchangeable. Would masses migrating radially change this?
