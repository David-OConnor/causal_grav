# Causal gravity


Note: You may need to reproduce luminosity profiles, as well as rotation curves.

Gravitomagnetism
Frame drag
Lense-Tillman (sp?)


## Observational phenomena

### Galaxy rotation curves

### The Bullet Cluster

### (Other evidence pointing to Dark Matter)


## Historical methods


### Extent of exploration using GR


### Why Newtonian mechanics has been assumed to be correct
(Limit at long distances of GR being newtonian etc)
Which of these assumptions appear to be valid, and which not. Describe the common reasons why GR is considered to be not necessary, and/or mentions (or absenses) of it in the papers positing ΛCDM non-baryonic matter.


### Justification of Newtonian models without these effects
We must prove that the relevant GR effects are irrelevant. Even if this paper, and those cited in teh references, contain errors or invalid conclusions, existing work that, for example, posits dark matter or mond based on rotational curves, the bullet cluster etc, must demonstrate that their conclusions are still valid in light of these GR effects.

(Maybe this section in the conclusion?)
A point perhaps bigger than the explanation for rotation curves/bullet cluster: Must first update the existing models to take into account these GR effects, or demonstrate why they don't appreciably change the model.


## On the structure of spiral galaxies

### Why the arms, disc, bulge


## Methods

### Models:
 - Traditional Newton without DM halo
 - Traditional Newton with DM halo
 - Newton, naive causal
 - Newton, causal with mass currents/frame drag etc.

Assumptions, setup, parameters, and how these match experimental data (or differ from it)

### Mass currents / Gravitomagnetism

#### Analogs to EM induction, nabla x B (Ampere's law)

### Frame drag / Lense-Tillman


## Comparison to MOND


## Comparison to standard dark matter (ΛCDM?)

## When we include both a ΛCDM halo, and gravitomagnetic effects
If our theory is to hold, we must show that the models predicting a non-baryonic halo no longer match experimental results for galaxy rotation, and the bullet cluster. It's not just that our result explains these: It's that these effects must be true based on GR, and that models including both them and the halo don't match experimental results.

It comes down to this: We have results demonstrating that rotation curves match  our understanding of gravity; a DM halo does *not* fit the results, and was added based on a flaw of earlier models.


## (optional; maybe a separate article?) On the general upheaval of existing ideas in science, and expected hostility.
