# Causal gravity


Gravitomagnetism
Frame drag
Lense-Tillman (sp?)

## Observational phenomena

### Galaxy rotation curves

### The Bullet Cluster

### (Other evidence pointing to Dark Matter)


## Historical methods


### Extent of exploration using GR


### Why Newtonian mechanics has been assumed to be correct
(Limit at long distances of GR being newtonian etc)
Which of these assumptions appear to be valid, and which note


### Justification of Newtonian models without these effects
We must prove that the relevant GR effects are irrelevant. Even if this paper, and those cited in teh references, contain errors or invalid conclusions, existing work that, for example, posits dark matter or mond based on rotational curves, the bullet cluster etc, must demonstrate that their conclusions are still valid in light of these GR effects.


## On the structure of spiral galaxies

### Why the arms, disc, bulge


## Methods

### Models:
 - Traditional Newton without DM halo
 - Traditional Newton with DM halo
 - Newton, naive causal
 - Newton, causal with mass currents/frame drag etc.

### Mass currents / Gravitomagnetism

#### Analogs to EM induction, nabla x B (Ampere's law)

### Frame drag / Lense-Tillman


## Comparison to MOND


## Comparison to standard dark matter (ACDM?)


## (optional; maybe a separate article?) On the general upheaval of existing ideas in science, and expected hostility.
