# Causal gravity


Note: You may need to reproduce luminosity profiles, as well as rotation curves.

Gravitomagnetism
Frame drag
Lense-Tillman (sp?)


## Observational phenomena

### Galaxy rotation curves

### The Bullet Cluster

### (Other evidence pointing to Dark Matter)


## Historical methods


### Extent of exploration using GR


### Why Newtonian mechanics has been assumed to be correct
(Limit at long distances of GR being newtonian etc)
Which of these assumptions appear to be valid, and which not. Describe the common reasons why GR is considered to be not necessary, and/or mentions (or absenses) of it in the papers positing ΛCDM non-baryonic matter.


### Justification of Newtonian models without these effects
We must prove that the relevant GR effects are irrelevant. Even if this paper, and those cited in teh references, contain errors or invalid conclusions, existing work that, for example, posits dark matter or mond based on rotational curves, the bullet cluster etc, must demonstrate that their conclusions are still valid in light of these GR effects.

(Maybe this section in the conclusion?)
A point perhaps bigger than the explanation for rotation curves/bullet cluster: Must first update the existing models to take into account these GR effects, or demonstrate why they don't appreciably change the model.

#### "one-dimensional circular-velocity thin disk model"
As traditional model that doesn't work, triggering dark matter halo theories.

## On the structure of spiral galaxies

### Why the arms, disc, bulge


## Methods

### Models:
 - Traditional Newton without DM halo
 - Traditional Newton with DM halo
 - Newton, naive causal
 - Newton, causal with mass currents/frame drag etc.

A detailed description of our model. What factors this and others take into account; what they don't. E.g. hyow much hydrodyannmics with gas clouds? Limitations with particle account set.

Note: Overfitting risk from how we generate mass distribution initial conditions based on known properties of galaxies.


Note that a key perk of our approach is generality; lack of arbitrary parameters.

List of GR effects we include, and ommite. Justify each of the latter


## Our modeling approach vs analytic equations
What this paper offers that others don't and vice-versa. On their different appraoches, and how they align.


Assumptions, setup, parameters, and how these match experimental data (or differ from it)

### Mass currents / Gravitomagnetism / Frame drag / Lense-Tillman

#### Analogs to EM induction, nabla x B (Ampere's law)

## Comparison to MOND


## Comparison to standard dark matter (ΛCDM?)

## When we include both a ΛCDM halo, and gravitomagnetic effects
If our theory is to hold, we must show that the models predicting a non-baryonic halo no longer match experimental results for galaxy rotation, and the bullet cluster. It's not just that our result explains these: It's that these effects must be true based on GR, and that models including both them and the halo don't match experimental results.

It comes down to this: We have results demonstrating that rotation curves match  our understanding of gravity; a DM halo does *not* fit the results, and was added based on a flaw of earlier models.


## A simple MOND model
Demonstrate that, using data from several real galaxies, MOND produces stable galaxies, while normal Netwton simulations leads
to them flying apart.


## Previous work on using GR to account for galaxy rotation curve anomalies
Ludwig (2024): Uses fluid dynamics and plasma physics experience to posit use of the gravitomagnetic effect from rotating masses. (Or clustesr of mass?) Claims, using analytic equations, that this effect entirely accounts for the rotation curves of NGC1560, NGC3198, and NGC 3115.

Le Corre (2015+): Finds the gravitomagnetic effect too low to account for the rotation curve of a single galaxy alone, but finds that it, in the large scale structure of galaxies, explains the rotation curve for galaxies in this structure

Cooperstock and Tieu (2005): Explains rotation curves of NGC3031, NGC3198, and NGC7331 are consistent with visual matter, using a pressure-free fluid in GR. (Which GR principle?)


## Previous refutations of the gravitomagnetic effect
Toth (2021) concludes that the gravitomagnetic effect does not have an effect on Galaxy rotations. The model this paper uses is, and it does not...

## Model galaxies
- Bullet cluster
- NGC 1560
- NGC 3198
- NGC 3115

Note on the inherrent difficulty of modeling these based on the limited data we have.


## Testable predictions


## Improvemenets for future model iterations
- More pressure interactions
- Higher particle density
- Attempt to form galaxies from gas/dust clouds instead of starting with known properties
- Take into account (x affect of GR, hydrodynamics etc)
- Mesh approach for hydrodynamics instead of SPH
